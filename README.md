## 🤖 AI Involvement (Project Notes)

> During the final stages of this project, I experimented with **Claude AI** to refine certain features and enhance parts of the design.
> However, while working with AI tools, I encountered several challenges — including inaccurate outputs and moments when I couldn’t fully grasp some implementations.
> In those cases, I revisited the results, explored the logic in depth, and learned from the AI explanations before applying them manually.
> This process not only improved the project’s overall quality but also deepened my understanding of **AI-assisted development** and practical backend design. 💡
